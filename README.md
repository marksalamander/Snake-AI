# Snake-AI
Snake AI using genetic algorithm.

This is a snake game made as an introduction to learning about AI. 

A genetic algorithm is used to create new generations of snakes, producing offspring from the top 5 snakes. The parents are determined through score, and the moves each parents made are passed down to the children. These moves are mutated based on a mutation rate of 0.1.

Currently, the snake AI is only able to learn to keep its self alive, with no prioritization of eating the food (increasing its score). Implementation of a neural network to work alongside the genetic algorithm is planned.
